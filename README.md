## Biometrics-authenticated key exchange

This project aims to implement a biometrics-authenticated key exchange protocol designed at da-sec during my internship.

### Motivation

TODO

### Dependencies

- Openssl C library
- C++ build tools: CMake, make, GCC...

### Building

Create a `build` directory and compile the app inside:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The building has been tested on Archlinux x64 only, feel free to open an issue if you experience building issues with another architecture.
